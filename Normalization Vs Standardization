Q1)Is feature scaling required??
Q2)Now S vs N?
=>Mostly we will be using standardization
Normalization,specially min-max will be used when we know the minimum and maximum value of our dataset
eg:-In image processing when we work on CNN(Convonutional Neural Network),we passed images,which had colour channels having minimum value 0 and maximum value 255=>min-max scaling

when you have no idea-->standard scaling
when you have outliers-->robust scaling
when you have sparse matrix-->max-absolute scaling
