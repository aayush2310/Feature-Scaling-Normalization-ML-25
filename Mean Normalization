x(i)'=(x(i)-x(mean))/(x(max)-x(min))

//We are doing mean centering.
The new values obtained will lie between -1 and 1
if the value is less than mean,then we will get a negative number else positive

Used rarely,no class present in sklearn,need to create the class manually

used where we need centered data,but people use standardization in its place
