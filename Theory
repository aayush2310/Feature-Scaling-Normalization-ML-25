Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for ML.The goal of Normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale,without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.

Types:-
1)Min-Max Scaling
2)Mean Normalization
3)Max absolute scaling
4)Robust scaling
